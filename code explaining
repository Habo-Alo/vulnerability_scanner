1.	Importing the required modules:

from scapy.all import IP, TCP, sr1

•	This line imports the necessary modules from the Scapy library. IP is used for creating IP packets, TCP is used for creating TCP segments, and sr1 is the function used for sending and receiving packets.

3.	Defining the vulnerability_scan() function:

def vulnerability_scan(target_ip, port):

•	This line defines the vulnerability_scan() function, which takes a target IP address and a port number as arguments.

5.	Crafting the TCP SYN packet:

packet = IP(dst=target_ip) / TCP(dport=port, flags="S")

•	This line constructs a TCP SYN packet using the IP and TCP objects from Scapy. The IP(dst=target_ip) sets the destination IP address of the packet to the target IP address provided. The TCP(dport=port, flags="S") sets the destination port and flags of the TCP packet. Here, we set the destination port to the specified port and the TCP flag to “S” (SYN) to initiate a TCP connection.

8.	Sending the packet and capturing the response:

response = sr1(packet, timeout=3, verbose=0)

•	This line sends the crafted packet using the sr1() function, which sends the packet and waits for a single response. The packet is the packet to be sent, timeout=3 sets the maximum time to wait for a response (3 seconds in this case), and verbose=0 suppresses output to the console. The response is stored in the response variable.

11.	Analyzing the response:

if response is not None:
    if response.haslayer(TCP) and response[TCP].flags == "SA":
        return f"Port {port} is open."
    else:
        return f"Port {port} is closed."
else:
    return f"Port {port} is filtered."

•	These lines check the response to determine the state of the port. First, it checks if the response is not None to ensure that a response was received. Then, it verifies if the response has a TCP layer using response.haslayer(TCP). If both conditions are met, it checks if the TCP flags of the response indicate that the port is open (response[TCP].flags == "SA" where “SA” stands for SYN-ACK response). If the port is open, it returns a message stating that the port is open. Otherwise, if the port is not open (the flags do not indicate an open port), it returns a message stating that the port is closed. If there is no response, it returns a message stating that the port is filtered.

19.	Example usage: scanning port 80 on the target IP:

target_ip = "192.168.1.100"
port = 80
scan_result = vulnerability_scan(target_ip, port)

•	These lines set the target_ip variable to the desired IP address to scan and the port variable to the desired port number. The vulnerability_scan() function is called with the target_ip and port as arguments, and the result is stored in the scan_result variable.

24.	Displaying the scan result:

print(scan_result)

•	This line prints the scan result, which is the message indicating whether the port is open, closed, or filtered
